Recent advances in the field of health geography have greatly improved our understanding of the role played by geographic distribution of health services in population health maintenance. However, most of this knowledge has accrued for hospital and specialty services and services in rural areas. Much less is known about the effect of distance to and supply of primary care on primary care utilization, particularly in the U.S.},

	abstract = {Climate change is widely recognised as the greatest threat to public health this century, but ‘climate change and health’ often refers to a narrow and limited focus on
              emissions
              , and the
              impacts
              of the climate crisis, rather than a holistic assessment of economic structures and systems of oppression. This tunnel vision misses key aspects of the climate change and health intersection, such as the enforcers of planetary destruction such as the military, police, and trade, and can also lead down dangerous alleyways such as ‘net’ zero, overpopulation arguments and green extractivism. Tunnel vision also limits health to the absence of the disease at the individual level, rather than sickness or health within systems themselves. Conceptualising health as political, ecological, and collective is essential for tackling the root causes of health injustice. Alternative economic paradigms can offer possibilities for fairer ecological futures that prioritise health and wellbeing. Examples such as degrowth, doughnut economics and ecosocialism, and their relationship with health, are described. The importance of reparations in various forms, to repair previous and ongoing harm, are discussed. Breaking free from tunnel vision is not simply an intellectual endeavour, but a practice. Moving towards new paradigms requires movement building and cultivating radical imagination. The review highlights lessons which can be learnt from abolitionist movements and progressive political struggles across the world. This review provides ideas and examples of how to break free from tunnel vision for climate change and health by highlighting and analysing the work of multiple organisations who are working towards social and economic transformation. Key considerations for the health community are provided, including working in solidarity with others, prioritising community-led solutions, and using our voice, skills, and capacity to address the structural diagnosis—colonial capitalism.},

Mobile signaling data provide new technological tools to investigate the subject. Based on the data of 20 million 2G mobile phone users in downtown Shanghai and the land use data of urban public service facilities, this study explores the spatiotemporal correlation between population density and public service facilities’ locations in downtown Shanghai and its variation laws. The correlation between individual population density at day vs. night and urban public service facilities distribution was also examined from a dynamic perspective. The results show a correlation between service facilities’ locations and urban population density at different times of the day. As a result, the average population density observed over a long period of time (day-time periodicity or longer) with census data or remote sensing data does not directly correlation with the distribution of public service facilities despite its correlation with public service facilities distribution. Among them, there is a significant spatial correlation between public service facilities and daytime population density and a significant spatial correlation between non-public service facilities and night-time population density. The spatial and temporal changes in the relationship between urban population density and service facilities is due to changing crowd behavior; however, the density of specific types of behavior is the real factor that affects the layout of urban public service facilities. The results show that mobile signaling data and land use data of service facilities are of great value for studying the spatiotemporal correlations between urban population density and service facilities.},

	abstract = {Background:  The growing urban population imposes additional challenges for health systems in low- and middleincome countries (LMICs). We explored the economic burden and inequities in healthcare utilisation across slum, non-slum and levels of wealth among urban residents in LMICs. Methods:  This scoping review presents a narrative synthesis and descriptive analysis of studies conducted in urban areas of LMICs. We categorised studies as conducted only in slums, city-wide studies with measures of wealth and conducted in both slums and non-slums settlements. We estimated the mean costs of accessing healthcare, the incidence of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) and the progressiveness and equity of health expenditures. The definitions of slums used in the studies were mapped against the 2018 UN-Habitat definition. We developed an evi‑dence map to identify research gaps on the economics of healthcare access in LMICs. Results:  We identified 64 studies for inclusion, the majority of which were from South-East Asia (59\%) and classified as city-wide (58\%). We found severe economic burden across health conditions, wealth quintiles and study types. Compared with city-wide studies, slum studies reported higher direct costs of accessing health care for acute condi‑tions and lower costs for chronic and unspecified health conditions. Healthcare expenditures for chronic conditions were highest amongst the richest wealth quintiles for slum studies and more equally distributed across all wealth quintiles for city-wide studies. The incidence of CHE was similar across all wealth quintiles in slum studies and concen‑trated among the poorest residents in city-wide studies. None of the definitions of slums used covered all charac‑teristics proposed by UN-Habitat. The evidence map showed that city-wide studies, studies conducted in India and studies on unspecified health conditions dominated the current evidence on the economics of healthcare access. Most of the evidence was classified as poor quality.},

	abstract = {Although access to health care is frequently identified as a goal for health care policy, the precise meaning of access to health care often remains unclear. We present a conceptual framework that defines access to health care as the empowerment of an individual to use health care and as a multidimensional concept based on the interaction (or degree of fit) between health care systems and individuals, households, and communities. Three dimensions of access are identified: availability, affordability, and acceptability, through which access can be evaluated directly instead of focusing on utilisation of care as a proxy for access. We present the case for the comprehensive evaluation of health care systems as well as the dimensions of access, and the factors underlying each dimension. Such systemic analyses can inform policy-makers about the ‘fit’ between needs for health care and receipt of care, and provide the basis for developing policies that promote improvements in the empowerment to use care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A key component of achieving universal health coverage is ensuring that all populations have access to quality health care. Examining where gains have occurred or progress has faltered across and within countries is crucial to guiding decisions and strategies for future improvement. We used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) to assess personal health-care access and quality with the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index for 195 countries and territories, as well as subnational locations in seven countries, from 1990 to 2016.
METHODS: Drawing from established methods and updated estimates from GBD 2016, we used 32 causes from which death should not occur in the presence of effective care to approximate personal health-care access and quality by location and over time. To better isolate potential effects of personal health-care access and quality from underlying risk factor patterns, we risk-standardised cause-specific deaths due to non-cancers by location-year, replacing the local joint exposure of environmental and behavioural risks with the global level of exposure. Supported by the expansion of cancer registry data in GBD 2016, we used mortality-to-incidence ratios for cancers instead of risk-standardised death rates to provide a stronger signal of the effects of personal health care and access on cancer survival. We transformed each cause to a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the first percentile (worst) observed between 1990 and 2016, and 100 as the 99th percentile (best); we set these thresholds at the country level, and then applied them to subnational locations. We applied a principal components analysis to construct the HAQ Index using all scaled cause values, providing an overall score of 0-100 of personal health-care access and quality by location over time. We then compared HAQ Index levels and trends by quintiles on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary measure of overall development. As derived from the broader GBD study and other data sources, we examined relationships between national HAQ Index scores and potential correlates of performance, such as total health spending per capita.
FINDINGS: In 2016, HAQ Index performance spanned from a high of 97·1 (95\% UI 95·8-98·1) in Iceland, followed by 96·6 (94·9-97·9) in Norway and 96·1 (94·5-97·3) in the Netherlands, to values as low as 18·6 (13·1-24·4) in the Central African Republic, 19·0 (14·3-23·7) in Somalia, and 23·4 (20·2-26·8) in Guinea-Bissau. The pace of progress achieved between 1990 and 2016 varied, with markedly faster improvements occurring between 2000 and 2016 for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, whereas several countries in Latin America and elsewhere saw progress stagnate after experiencing considerable advances in the HAQ Index between 1990 and 2000. Striking subnational disparities emerged in personal health-care access and quality, with China and India having particularly large gaps between locations with the highest and lowest scores in 2016. In China, performance ranged from 91·5 (89·1-93·6) in Beijing to 48·0 (43·4-53·2) in Tibet (a 43·5-point difference), while India saw a 30·8-point disparity, from 64·8 (59·6-68·8) in Goa to 34·0 (30·3-38·1) in Assam. Japan recorded the smallest range in subnational HAQ performance in 2016 (a 4·8-point difference), whereas differences between subnational locations with the highest and lowest HAQ Index values were more than two times as high for the USA and three times as high for England. State-level gaps in the HAQ Index in Mexico somewhat narrowed from 1990 to 2016 (from a 20·9-point to 17·0-point difference), whereas in Brazil, disparities slightly increased across states during this time (a 17·2-point to 20·4-point difference). Performance on the HAQ Index showed strong linkages to overall development, with high and high-middle SDI countries generally having higher scores and faster gains for non-communicable diseases. Nonetheless, countries across the development spectrum saw substantial gains in some key health service areas from 2000 to 2016, most notably vaccine-preventable diseases. Overall, national performance on the HAQ Index was positively associated with higher levels of total health spending per capita, as well as health systems inputs, but these relationships were quite heterogeneous, particularly among low-to-middle SDI countries.
INTERPRETATION: GBD 2016 provides a more detailed understanding of past success and current challenges in improving personal health-care access and quality worldwide. Despite substantial gains since 2000, many low-SDI and middle-SDI countries face considerable challenges unless heightened policy action and investments focus on advancing access to and quality of health care across key health services, especially non-communicable diseases. Stagnating or minimal improvements experienced by several low-middle to high-middle SDI countries could reflect the complexities of re-orienting both primary and secondary health-care services beyond the more limited foci of the Millennium Development Goals. Alongside initiatives to strengthen public health programmes, the pursuit of universal health coverage hinges upon improving both access and quality worldwide, and thus requires adopting a more comprehensive view-and subsequent provision-of quality health care for all populations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Economic recession might worsen health in low-income and middle-income countries with precarious job markets and weak social protection systems. Between 2014-16, a major economic crisis occurred in Brazil. We aimed to assess the association between economic recession and adult mortality in Brazil and to ascertain whether health and social welfare programmes in the country had a protective effect against the negative impact of this recession.
METHODS: In this longitudinal analysis, we obtained data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics, the Ministry of Social Development and Fight Against Hunger, and the Information System for the Public Budget in Health to assess changes in state unemployment level and mortality among adults (aged ≥15 years) in Brazil between 2012 and 2017. Outcomes were municipal all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates for all adults and across population subgroups stratified by age, sex, and race. We used fixed-effect panel regression models with quarterly timepoints to assess the association between recession and changes in mortality. Mortality and unemployment rates were detrended using Hodrick-Prescott filters to assess cyclical variation and control for underlying trends. We tested interactions between unemployment and terciles of municipal social protection and health-care expenditure to assess whether the relationship between unemployment and mortality varied.
FINDINGS: Between 2012 and 2017, 7 069 242 deaths were recorded among adults (aged ≥15 years) in 5565 municipalities in Brazil. During this time period, the mean crude municipal adult mortality rate increased by 8·0\% from 143·1 deaths per 100 000 in 2012 to 154·5 deaths per 100 000 in 2017. An increase in unemployment rate of 1 percentage-point was associated with a 0·50 increase per 100 000 population per rter (95\% CI 0·09-0·91) in all-cause mortality, mainly due to cancer and cardiovascular disease. Between 2012 and 2017, higher unemployment accounted for 31 415 excess deaths (95\% CI 29 698-33 132). All-cause mortality increased among black or mixed race (pardo) Brazilians (a 0·46 increase [95\% CI 0·15-0·80]), men (0·67 [0·22-1·13]), and individuals aged 30-59 years (0·43 [0·16-0·69] per 1 percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate. No significant association was identified between unemployment and all-cause mortality for white Brazilian, women, adolescents (aged 15-29 years), or older and retired individuals (aged ≥60 years). In municipalities with high expenditure on health and social protection programmes, no significant increases in recession-related mortality were observed.
INTERPRETATION: The Brazilian recession contributed to increases in mortality. However, health and social protection expenditure seemed to mitigate detrimental health effects, especially among vulnerable populations. This evidence provides support for stronger health and social protection systems globally.

	abstract = {Background: 
The high fragmentation and decentralization in the provision of health care services that characterizes Argentina's health system, as well as the economic and social inequalities, challenge the achievement of the Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The objective of this study is to measure socioeconomic-related inequality and horizontal inequity in the use of health care services in Argentina as well as identify the factors that contribute to these disparities.

Methods:
The 2013 National Risk Factor Survey, developed by the Ministry of Health of Argentina, was used to measure socioeconomic-related inequality and inequity in the use of health care services through concentration curves, the Erreygers concentration index, and the index of horizontal inequity. Econometric micro-decomposition was applied to estimate the contribution of each determining factor to inequality in the use of health care services.

Results:
The Erreygers concentration index for the use of health care services was 0.1223, evidencing pro-rich inequalities. By adding variables of health care needs, the horizontal inequity index was 0.1296. Non-need factors such as education and health coverage with social security increase pro-rich inequality.

Conclusions:
The Argentine health system shows pro-rich inequality in the use of health care services. It is necessary to design strategies to improve articulation between the three coverage subsectors and national, provincial, and municipal governments to keep the commitment of "not leaving anyone behind." The results showed here could provide lessons for countries with similar contexts and challenges in public health.},

	abstract = {Background: The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has claimed thousands of lives worldwide and disrupted the health system in many countries. As the national emergency care capacity is a crucial part of the COVID-19 response, we evaluated the Brazilian Health Care System response preparedness against the COVID-19 pandemic., Methods: A retrospective and ecological study was performed with data retrieved from the Brazilian Information Technology Department of the Public Health Care System. The numbers of intensive care (ICU) and hospital beds, general or intensivist physicians, nurses, nursing technicians, physiotherapists, and ventilators from each health region were extracted. Beds per health professionals and ventilators per population rates were assessed. A health service accessibility index was created using a two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA). A spatial analysis using Getis-Ord Gi* was performed to identify areas lacking access to high-complexity centers (HCC)., Results: As of February 2020, Brazil had 35,682 ICU beds, 426,388 hospital beds, and 65,411 ventilators. In addition, 17,240 new ICU beds were created in June 2020. The South and Southeast regions have the highest rates of professionals and infrastructure to attend patients with COVID-19 compared with the northern region. The north region has the lowest accessibility to ICUs., Conclusions: The Brazilian Health Care System is unevenly distributed across the country. The inequitable distribution of health facilities, equipment, and human resources led to inadequate preparedness to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the ineffectiveness of public measures of the municipal and federal administrations aggravated the pandemic in Brazil.},

	abstract = {Victims of epidemics, slavery, genocide, and countless other episodes of violence during the colonial enterprise in Brazil, which continues decades into the 21st century in some regions, Indigenous peoples face health inequities resulting from a five-century history of social marginalization and vulnerability. Since the late 1990s, the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples in the country have benefited from progressive legislation that values sociocultural diversity within a public primary healthcare subsystem attending to Indigenous peoples living in federal Indigenous lands. However, these transcultural ideals remain elusive in practice. The Indigenous Healthcare Subsystem continues to suffer from numerous systemic problems, including low quality of local services, lack of health professional training for work in intercultural contexts, and unpreparedness for attending to health emergencies involving Indigenous peoples living in voluntary isolation. Being Indigenous in Brazil in the 2020s implies greater chances of higher infant mortality, lower life expectancy, suffering from undernutrition and anemia during childhood, living with a high burden of infectious and parasitic diseases, being exposed to a swift process of nutritional transition, and experiencing a surge in chronic violence. Community case studies have shown the importance of close patient follow-up over long periods of time, the heavy burden of disease due to nutrition transition since the mid-1980s, the relevance of international reference curves for evaluating Indigenous child undernutrition, and failures of primary healthcare provided to Indigenous populations. Improvements in national health information systems in Brazil beginning in the early 2000s have shown external causes, perinatal diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases, and respiratory diseases to be the leading causes of death among the country’s Indigenous population.},

	abstract = {Objective
Paraguay’s health care system is characterized by segmented provision and low
public spending, with limited coverage and asymmetries in terms of access
and quality of care. The present study provides national estimates of
income-related inequality in health care utilization and trends in the
country over the past two decades.

Methods
Using data from the Paraguayan Permanent Household Survey, we estimated
socioeconomic inequality in health care use during the period 1999–2018. We
used poverty-to-income ratio as the socioeconomic stratifier and defined
health care use as having reported a health problem and subsequent health
care use in the last 90 days before interview. Inequality was summarized by
rank- and level-based versions of the Concentration Index for binary
outcomes.

Results
Inequalities affecting those with lower incomes were present in all years
assessed, although the magnitude of these inequalities declined over time.
Inequality as expressed by the rank-based index decreased from 0.209 (95\%CI
0.164; 0.253) in 1999 to 0.032 (95\%CI -0.010; 0.075) in 2018. The
level-based index decreased from 0.076 (95\%CI -0.029; 0.182) in 1999 to
0.024 (0.002; 0.045) in 2018. Trends in both indices were generally stable
from 1999 to 2009, with a noticeable decrease in 2010. The sharpest
decreases relative to the 1999 baseline were observed in the period
2010–2018, reflecting changes in health care use and income distribution.
Stratification by area, sex and older people suggest similar trends within
subgroups.

Conclusions
Decreases in inequality coincide temporally with increments in public health
expenditure, removal of user fees in public health care facilities and the
expansion of conditional cash-transfer programmes. Future research should
disentangle the role of each of these policies in explaining the trends
described.},

	abstract = {Given the challenges related to reducing socio-economic and health inequalities, building specific health system approaches for Indigenous peoples is critical. In Brazil, following constitutional reforms that led to the universalization of health care in the late 1980s, a specific health subsystem was created for Indigenous peoples in 1999. In this paper, we use a historical perspective to contextualize the creation of the Indigenous Health Subsystem in Brazil. This study is based on data from interviews with Indigenous and non-Indigenous subjects and document-based analysis. In the 1980s, during the post-dictatorship period in Brazil, the emergence of Indigenous movements in the country and the support for pro-Indigenous organizations helped establish a political agenda that emphasized a broad range of issues, including the right to a specific health policy. Indigenous leaders established alliances with participants of the Brazilian health reform movement, which resulted in broad debates about the specificities of Indigenous peoples, and the need for a specific health subsystem. We highlight three main points in our analysis: (1) the centrality of a holistic health perspective; (2) the emphasis on social participation; (3) the need for the reorganization of health care. These points proved to be convergent with the development of the Brazilian health reform and were expressed in documents of the Indigenist Missionary Council (CIMI) and the Union of Indigenous Nations (UNI). They were also consolidated in the final report of the First National Conference on the Protection of Indigenous Health in 1986, becoming the cornerstone of the national Indigenous health policy declared in 1999. Our analysis reveals that Indigenous people and pro-Indigenous groups were key players in the development of the Indigenous Health Subsystem in Brazil.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity conservation and mental health and wellbeing are of increasing global concern, with growing relevance to planning and policy. A growing body of literature exploring the relationships between biodiversity and mental health and wellbeing - based on early research conducted largely from social science perspectives - suggests that particular qualities within natural environments confer particular benefits. Results so far have been inconclusive and inconsistent, contributing to an incohesive body of evidence. While past reviews have focussed on reporting variations in results, the present study builds on early reviews by exploring variations from the perspective of author disciplines and the use of different guiding theories, and variables used to measure biodiversity, mental health and wellbeing. This aims to address a research gap in understanding whether research in this topic has become more interdisciplinary or has employed more consistent study designs, which were highlighted as priorities in past reviews, but the progress of which has not yet been explored in depth. We found that research connecting biodiversity and mental health and wellbeing has become only marginally more interdisciplinary in recent years, and there is still a large inconsistency in the use of guiding theories, variables and overall study designs. The variation in disciplinary perspectives and methods reflects a growing interest in this field and the variety of ways researchers are trying to understand and test the complex relationships between biodiversity and mental health and wellbeing. Our study shows that there are unique perspectives that different disciplines can contribute to this body of research and continuing to increase collaboration between disciplines with the use of consistent mixed methods approaches in future may contribute to a more cohesive body of evidence. We provide a framework to conceptualise recommendations for future research, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration at multiple scales, and importantly focusing on more specific, mechanistic studies to inform decision-making that provides co-benefits for biodiversity and mental health and wellbeing.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are being deforested worldwide, and the remaining fragments are suffering from biomass and biodiversity erosion. Quantifying this erosion is challenging because ground data on tropical biodiversity and biomass are often sparse. Here, we use an unprecedented dataset of 1819 field surveys covering the entire Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. We show that 83−85\% of the surveys presented losses in forest biomass and tree species richness, functional traits, and conservation value. On average, forest fragments have 25−32\% less biomass, 23−31\% fewer species, and 33, 36, and 42\% fewer individuals of late-successional, large-seeded, and endemic species, respectively. Biodiversity and biomass erosion are lower inside strictly protected conservation units, particularly in large ones. We estimate that biomass erosion across the Atlantic Forest remnants is equivalent to the loss of 55−70 thousand km2 of forests or US\$2.3−2.6 billion in carbon credits. These figures have direct implications on mechanisms of climate change mitigation., Quantifying forest degradation and biodiversity losses is necessary to inform conservation and restoration policies. Here the authors analyze a large dataset for the Atlantic Forest in South America to quantify losses in forest biomass and tree species richness, functional traits, and conservation value.},

Se realizaron 39 entrevistas a profundidad con "brasiguayos" residentes en Ypehjú, Salto del Guairá y Pedro Juan Caballero. Se constató que la circularidad de los "brasiguayos" en las fronteras nacionales de Paraguay y Brasil es motivada por la demanda de servicios públicos en las áreas de salud y educación, de beneficios asistenciales, por compras, visitas, religión y trabajo. Esas demandas revelan las diferentes estrategias de adaptación y supervivencia de los "brasiguayos" residentes en dicha región y la importancia de sus lazos formales e informales para intercambiar recursos, información y solidaridad que les permitan acceder a bienes y servicios brasileños. The purpose of this work, which is part of a doctoral thesis, is to present the different motivations of "brasiguaios" to move between the border towns of Paraguay and Brazil, more specifically those residing in Paraguayan towns which share a border with Brazil. Thirty-nine in-depth interviews were performed with the "brasiguaios" residents in the towns of Ypehjú, Salto del Guaira and Pedro Juan Caballero. It was found that the circulation of "brasiguaios" between the national border of Paraguay and Brazil is motivated by the demand for public services in the areas of health and education, welfare benefits, for shopping, visiting people, religion and work. These demands reveal the different adaptation and survival strategies of "brasiguaios", the residents living in Paraguayan towns on the border of Brazil, and the importance of their formal and informal ties to share resources, information and solidarity to enable them to access Brazilian goods and services. Moreover, the attention of the policymakers need to be drawn to these regions of Brazil's national borders, since this intense circulation can interfere with the balance of supply and demand for public services in Brazil.},

This paper describes a model, the Health Care Access Barriers Model (HCAB), which provides a taxonomy and practical framework for the classification, analysis and reporting of those modifiable health care access barriers that are associated with health care disparities. The model describes three categories of modifiable health care access barriers: financial, structural, and cognitive. The three types of barriers are reciprocally reinforcing and affect health care access individually or in concert. These barriers are associated with screening, late presentation to care, and lack of treatment, which in turn result in poor health outcomes and health disparities. By targeting those barriers that are measurable and modifiable the model facilitates root-cause analysis and intervention design.},

	abstract = {Facilitating access is concerned with helping people to command appropriate health care resources in order to preserve or improve their health. Access is a complex concept and at least four aspects require evaluation. If services are available and there is an adequate supply of services, then the opportunity to obtain health care exists, and a population may 'have access' to services. The extent to which a population 'gains access' also depends on financial, organisational and social or cultural barriers that limit the utilisation of services. Thus access measured in terms of utilisation is dependent on the affordability, physical accessibility and acceptability of services and not merely adequacy of supply. Services available must be relevant and effective if the population is to 'gain access to satisfactory health outcomes'. The availability of services, and barriers to access, have to be considered in the context of the differing perspectives, health needs and material and cultural settings of diverse groups in society. Equity of access may be measured in terms of the availability, utilisation or outcomes of services. Both horizontal and vertical dimensions of equity require consideration.},

	abstract = {Background: Developing essential health services through non-governmental organisations (NGOs) is an important strategy for progressing towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC), especially in low- and middle-income countries. It is crucial to understand NGOs’ role in reaching UHC and the best way to engage them.
Objective: This study reviewed the role of NGOs and their engagement strategies in progress toward UHC.
Method: We systematically reviewed studies from five databases (PubMed, Web of Science (ISI), ProQuest, EMBASE and Scopus) that investigated NGOs interventions in public health-related activities. The quality of the selected studies was assessed using the mixed methods appraisal tool. PRISMA reporting guidelines were followed. Findings: Seventy-eight studies met the eligibility criteria. NGOs main activities related to service and population coverage and used different strategies to progress towards UHC. To ensure services coverage, NGOs provided adequate and competent human resources, necessary health equipment and facilities, and provided public health and health care services strategies. To achieve population coverage, they provided services to vulnerable groups through community participation. Most studies were conducted in middle-income countries. Overall, the quality of the reported evidence was good. The main funding sources of NGOs were self-financing and grants from the government, international organisations, and donors.
Conclusion: NGOs can play a significant role in the country’s progress towards UHC along with the government and other key health players. The government should use strategies and interventions in supporting NGOs, accelerating their movement toward UHC.},

	abstract = {Brazil has a monitoring system to track annual forest conversion in the Amazon and most recently to monitor the Cerrado biome. However, there is still a gap of annual land use and land cover (LULC) information in all Brazilian biomes in the country. Existing countrywide efforts to map land use and land cover lack regularly updates and high spatial resolution time-series data to better understand historical land use and land cover dynamics, and the subsequent impacts in the country biomes. In this study, we described a novel approach and the results achieved by a multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual land use and land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based on random forest applied to Landsat archive using Google Earth Engine. We mapped five major classes: forest, non-forest natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and water. These classes were broken into two sub-classification levels leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for the country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on a stratified random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89\% ranging from 73 to 95\% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture activities. Pasture expanded by 46\% from 1985 to 2017, and agriculture by 172\%, mostly replacing old pasture fields. We also identified that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation was undergoing some level of regrowth. Several applications of the MapBiomas dataset are underway, suggesting that reconstructing historical land use and land cover change maps is useful for advancing the science and to guide social, economic and environmental policy decision-making processes in Brazil.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To estimate the potential economic beneﬁts of closing the Indigenous health gap by quantifying the economic burden associated with Indigenous health inequality in the Northern Territory. Design, setting and participants: A cost-of-illness study was conducted from a societal perspective for NT residents for the period 2009e2013. The total cost of the Indigenous health gap was estimated by calculating the cost differences between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in health services, lost productivity and lost life-years on the basis of data from the 2011 census, as well as on burden of disease, health expenditure, welfare, taxation and other published ﬁnancial data. Main outcome measures: The total and per capita costs in three categories were analysed: direct health costs, the indirect costs of lost productivity, and intangible costs associated with premature deaths.
Results: The excess cost of the Indigenous health gap was estimated to be \$16.7 billion for the 5-year study period, equivalent to 19\% of the NT gross state product. The excess costs associated with the Indigenous health gap included 22\% caused by higher health expenditure for servicing the gap, 35\% attributable to lost productivity caused by illness, and 43\% associated with lost life-years.
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings highlight the long term potential beneﬁts of the Australian governments’ Closing the Gap initiative for the NT. Successful implementation of this initiative will require improving government services by combating discrimination, developing local economies, overcoming poverty, and reducing the disadvantages associated with remoteness.},

            Distance is a crucial feature of health service use and yet its application and utility to health care planning have not been well explored, particularly in the light of large‐scale international and national efforts such as Roll Back Malaria. We have developed a high‐resolution map of population‐to‐service access in four districts of Kenya. Theoretical physical access, based upon national targets, developed as part of the Kenyan health sector reform agenda, was compared with actual health service usage data among 1668 paediatric patients attending 81 sampled government health facilities. Actual and theoretical use were highly correlated. Patients in the larger districts of Kwale and Makueni, where access to government health facilities was relatively poor, travelled greater mean distances than those in Greater Kisii and Bondo. More than 60\% of the patients in the four districts attended health facilities within a 5‐km range. Interpolated physical access surfaces across districts highlighted areas of poor access and large differences between urban and rural settings. Users from rural communities travelled greater distances to health facilities than those in urban communities. The implications of planning and monitoring equitable delivery of clinical services at national and international levels are discussed.},

This review discusses recent literature on GIS and health care. It considers the use of GIS in analyzing health care need, access, and utilization; in planning and evaluating service locations; and in spatial decision support for health care delivery. The adoption of GIS by health care researchers and policy-makers will depend on access to integrated spatial data on health services utilization and outcomes and data that cut across human service systems. We also need to understand better the spatial behaviors of health care providers and consumers in the rapidly changing health care landscape and how geographic information affects these dynamic relationships.},

	abstract = {Background: This paper explores the geographical accessibility of health services in urban and rural areas of the South West of England, comparing two measures of geographical access and characterising the areas most remote from hospitals. Straight-line distance and drive-time to the nearest general practice (GP) and acute hospital (DGH) were calculated for postcodes and aggregated to 1991 Census wards. The correlation between the two measures was used to identify wards where straight-line distance was not an accurate predictor of drive-time. Wards over 25 km from a DGH were classified as 'remote', and characterised in terms of rurality, deprivation, age structure and health status of the population.
Results: The access measures were highly correlated (r2{\textgreater}0.93). The greatest differences were found in coastal and rural wards of the far South West. Median straight-line distance to GPs was 1 km (IQR = 0.6–2 km) and to DGHs, 12 km (IQR = 5–19 km). Deprivation and rates of premature limiting long term illness were raised in areas most distant from hospitals, but there was no evidence of higher premature mortality rates. Half of the wards remote from a DGH were not classed as rural by the Office for National Statistics. Almost a quarter of households in the wards furthest from hospitals had no car, and the proportion of households with access to two or more cars fell in the most remote areas.
Conclusion: Drive-time is a more accurate measure of access for peripheral and rural areas. Geographical access to health services, especially GPs, is good, but remoteness affects both rural and urban areas: studies concentrating purely on rural areas may underestimate geographical barriers to accessing health care. A sizeable minority of households still had no car in 1991, and few had more than one car, particularly in areas very close to and very distant from hospitals. Better measures of geographical access, which integrate public and private transport availability with distance and travel time, are required if an accurate reflection of the experience those without their own transport is to be obtained.},

Although some research has been conducted to assess the effectiveness of the representation of demand- (population) or supply- (destinations) side characteristics within such models, there have been few attempts to assess the implications of using alternative sources of network data. This study employs a sensitivity analysis approach to assess accessibility to GP surgeries in south Wales using proprietary and open sources of network data. Results suggest that there are significant differences between access scores derived from the use of networks which purport to portray the same features. Furthermore, the pattern of differences varies between urban and rural areas. Case studies are used to show that the actual representation of network-based features, often overlooked in previous research, can have important implications for the findings from such studies. We conclude by suggesting that the use of sensitivity analysis to assess geospatial data usability has a wider relevance for studies that involve the use of a range of GIS-based techniques in different application areas.},

	abstract = {Background: Inequalities in geographic access to health care result from the conﬁguration of facilities, population distribution, and the transportation infrastructure. In recent accessibility studies, the traditional distance measure (Euclidean) has been replaced with more plausible measures such as travel distance or time. Both network and raster-based methods are often utilized for estimating travel time in a Geographic Information System. Therefore, exploring the diﬀerences in the underlying data models and associated methods and their impact on geographic accessibility estimates is warranted.
Methods: We examine the assumptions present in population-based travel time models. Conceptual and practical diﬀerences between raster and network data models are reviewed, along with methodological implications for service area estimates. Our case study investigates Limited Access Areas deﬁned by Michigan’s Certiﬁcate of Need (CON) Program. Geographic accessibility is calculated by identifying the number of people residing more than 30 minutes from an acute care hospital. Both network and raster-based methods are implemented and their results are compared. We also examine sensitivity to changes in travel speed settings and population assignment.
Results: In both methods, the areas identiﬁed as having limited accessibility were similar in their location, conﬁguration, and shape. However, the number of people identiﬁed as having limited accessibility varied substantially between methods. Over all permutations, the raster-based method identiﬁed more area and people with limited accessibility. The raster-based method was more sensitive to travel speed settings, while the network-based method was more sensitive to the speciﬁc population assignment method employed in Michigan.
Conclusions: Diﬀerences between the underlying data models help to explain the variation in results between raster and network-based methods. Considering that the choice of data model/method may substantially alter the outcomes of a geographic accessibility analysis, we advise researchers to use caution in model selection. For policy, we recommend that Michigan adopt the network-based method or reevaluate the travel speed assignment rule in the raster-based method. Additionally, we recommend that the state revisit the population assignment method.},

	abstract = {Background: An increasing number of studies use GIS estimates of car travel times to health services, without presenting any evidence that the estimates are representative of real travel times. This investigation compared GIS estimates of travel times with the actual times reported by a sample of 475 cancer patients who had travelled by car to attend clinics at eight hospitals in the North of England.
Methods: Car travel times were estimated by GIS using the shortest road route between home address and hospital and average speed assumptions. These estimates were compared with reported journey times and straight line distances using graphical, correlation and regression techniques.
Results: There was a moderately strong association between reported times and estimated travel times (r = 0.856). Reported travel times were similarly related to straight line distances. Altogether, 50\% of travel time estimates were within five minutes of the time reported by respondents, 77\% were within ten minutes and 90\% were within fifteen minutes. The distribution of over- and underestimates was symmetrical, but estimated times tended to be longer than reported times with increasing distance from hospital. Almost all respondents rounded their travel time to the nearest five or ten minutes. The reason for many cases of reported journey times exceeding the estimated times was confirmed by respondents' comments as traffic congestion.
Conclusion: GIS estimates of car travel times were moderately close approximations to reported times. GIS travel time estimates may be superior to reported travel times for modelling purposes because reported times contain errors and can reflect unusual circumstances. Comparison with reported times did not suggest that estimated times were a more sensitive measure than straight line distance.},

We discuss some of the theory which might illuminate the possible impact of place on health inequalities. In the light of this theoretical debate, and focusing mainly on research from Britain, we review the empirical evidence concerning place as a contributor to health inequalities. It is concluded that while individual characteristics are very important for the health inequalities which are observed between people, their geographical setting also has some significance.

This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the evolution of humanitarian mapping within the OSM community, seeking to understand the spatial and temporal footprint of these large-scale mapping efforts. The spatio-temporal statistical analysis of OSM’s full history since 2008 showed that humanitarian mapping efforts added 60.5 million buildings and 4.5 million roads to the map. Overall, mapping in OSM was strongly biased towards regions with very high Human Development Index. However, humanitarian mapping efforts had a different footprint, predominantly focused on regions with medium and low human development. Despite these efforts, regions with low and medium human development only accounted for 28\% of the buildings and 16\% of the roads mapped in OSM although they were home to 46\% of the global population. Our results highlight the formidable impact of humanitarian mapping efforts such as post-disaster mapping campaigns to improve the spatial coverage of existing open geographic data and maps, but they also reveal the need to address the remaining stark data inequalities, which vary significantly across countries. We conclude with three recommendations directed at the humanitarian mapping community: (1) Improve methods to monitor mapping activity and identify where mapping is needed. (2) Rethink the design of projects which include humanitarian data generation to avoid non-sustainable outcomes. (3) Remove structural barriers to empower local communities and develop capacity.},

              To investigate the association, if any, between child mortality and distance to the nearest hospital.
            
            
              Methods
              The study was based on data from a 1‐year study of the cause of illness in febrile paediatric admissions to a district hospital in north‐east Tanzania. All villages in the catchment population were geolocated, and travel times were estimated from availability of local transport. Using bands of travel time to hospital, we compared admission rates, inpatient case fatality rates and child mortality rates in the catchment population using inpatient deaths as the numerator.
            
            
              Results
              Three thousand hundred and eleven children under the age of 5 years were included of whom 4.6\% died; 2307 were admitted from {\textless}3 h away of whom 3.4\% died and 804 were admitted from ≥3 h away of whom 8.0\% died. The admission rate declined from 125/1000 catchment population at {\textless}3 h away to 25/1000 at ≥3 h away, and the corresponding hospital deaths/catchment population were 4.3/1000 and 2.0/1000, respectively. Children admitted from more than 3 h away were more likely to be male, had a longer pre‐admission duration of illness and a shorter time between admission and death. Assuming uniform mortality in the catchment population, the predicted number of deaths not benefiting from hospital admission prior to death increased by 21.4\% per hour of travel time to hospital. If the same admission and death rates that were found at {\textless}3 h from the hospital applied to the whole catchment population and if hospital care conferred a 30\% survival benefit compared to home care, then 10.3\% of childhood deaths due to febrile illness in the catchment population would have been averted.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The mortality impact of poor access to hospital care in areas of high paediatric mortality is likely to be substantial although uncertainty over the mortality benefit of inpatient care is the largest constraint in making an accurate estimate.

              Objectif
              Investiguer l'association le cas échéant, entre la mortalité infantile et la distance à l'hôpital le plus proche.
            
            
              Méthodes
              L’étude a été basée sur les données d'une étude de 1 an sur la cause de la maladie dans les admisions d'enfants fébriles à l'hôpital de district dans le nord‐est de la Tanzanie. Tous les villages de la population d’étude ont été géo‐localisés et les durées de transport ont été estimées à partir de la disponibilité de transport local. En utilisant des intervalles de durées de voyage à l'hôpital, nous avons comparé les taux d'admission, de létalité des patients hospitalisés et de mortalité infantile dans la population d’étude avec comme numérateur les décès de patients hospitalisés.
            
            
              Résultats
              3111 enfants de moins de 5 ans ont été inclus dont 4,6\% sont décédés; 2307 ont été admis en moins de 3 h de trajet dont 3,4\% sont décédés et 804 ont été admis à ≥3 h de trajet dont 8,0\% sont décédés. Le taux d'admission diminuait en passant de 125/1000 dans la populatiopn d’étude pour des trajets {\textless}3 h à 25/1000 pour des trajets ≥3 h et les taux de décès à l'hôpital correspondant de la population d’étude étaient respectivement de 4,3/1000 et 2,0/1000. Les enfants admis pour un trajet ≥3 h étaient plus susceptibles d’être de sexe masculin, d'avoir une plus longue durée de la maladie avant l'admission et un temps plus court entre l'admission et le décès. En supposant une mortalité uniforme dans la population d’étude, le nombre attendu de décès ne bénéficiant pas d'admisison d'hôpital avant le décès augmentait de 21,4\% par heure de durée de trajet à l'hôpital. Si les mêmes taux d'admissions et de mortalité trouvés pour les trajets à l'hôpital {\textless}3 h étaient appliqués à l'ensemble de la population d’étude et si les soins hospitaliers conféraient un bénéfice de survie de 30\% par rapport aux soins à domicile, alors 10,3\% des décès d'enfants pour cause de maladie fébrile dans la population d’étude auraient été évités.
            
            
              Conclusion
              L'impact sur la mortalité de l'accès limité aux soins hospitaliers dans les zones avec une mortalité pédiatrique élevée est probablement importante même si l'incertitude sur le bénefice de la prestation des soins hospitaliers sur la mortalité est le plus grand obstacle à estimer de façon précise.

              Objetivo
              Investigar la asociación, si existe, entre la mortalidad infantil y la distancia hasta el hospital más cercano.
            
            
              Métodos
              El estudio se basó en datos de un estudio de 1 año sobre la causa de enfermedad en pacientes pediátricos febriles admitidos en un hospital distrital del nordeste de Tanzania. Todos los poblados dentro del área de estudio estaban geolocalizados, y los tiempos de viaje se calcularon según la disponibilidad del transporte local. Utilizando bandas del tiempo requerido para el traslado hasta el hospital, comparamos las tasas de admisión, tasas de mortalidad de pacientes hospitalizados y tasas de mortalidad infantil entre la población del área de estudio utilizando las muertes de pacientes ingresados como el numerador.
            
            
              Resultados
              Se incluyeron 3,111 niños menores de 5 años de los cuales un 4.6\% murió; 2307 fueron admitidos desde {\textless}3 horas de distancia, de los cuales un 3.4\% murió y 804 fueron admitidos desde ≥3 horas de distancia y de estos murió un 8.0\%. La tasa de admisión cayó de 125/1,000 entre la población de estudio a {\textless}3 h de distancia, a 25/1,000 a ≥3 horas de distancia, y las muertes hospitalarias /población de estudio correspondientes eran 4.3/1,000 y 2.0/1,000 respectivamente. Los niños admitidos, que vivían a más de 3h, tenían una mayor probabilidad de ser hombres, tenían una enfermedad con una mayor duración antes de ser admitidos y un menor periodo de duración entre la admisión y la muerte. Asumiendo una mortalidad uniforme en la población de estudio, el número vaticinado de muertes que no se benefician de la admisión hospitalaria antes de la muerte aumentó en 21.4\% por hora de viaje hasta el hospital. Si las mismas tasas de admisión y muerte que se encontraron a {\textless}3 h del hospital aplicasen a toda la población de estudio, y si los cuidados hospitalarios conferían un 30\% de beneficio de supervivencia en comparación con los cuidados recubidos en el hogar, entonces se podrían haber evitado un 10.3\% de las muertes infantiles debido a enfermedades febriles entre la población de estudio.
            
            
              Conclusiones
              El impacto sobre la mortalidad de un mal acceso a los cuidados hospitalarios en áreas con una alta mortalidad pediátrica podría ser sustancial, aunque la incerteza del beneficio de los cuidados hospitalarios sobre la mortalidad es la principal limitación para hacer una estimación precisa.},

	abstract = {Objectives To investigate whether there is an association between differences in travel time/travel distance to healthcare services and patients' health outcomes and assimilate the methodologies used to measure this.
Design Systematic Review. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Transport database, HMIC and EBM Reviews for studies up to 7 September 2016. Studies were excluded that included children (including maternity), emergency medical travel or countries classed as being in the global south.
Settings A wide range of settings within primary and secondary care (these were not restricted in the search).
Results 108 studies met the inclusion criteria. The results were mixed. 77\% of the included studies identified evidence of a distance decay association, whereby patients living further away from healthcare facilities they needed to attend had worse health outcomes (eg, survival rates, length of stay in hospital and non-attendance at follow-up) than those who lived closer. 6 of the studies identified the reverse (a distance bias effect) whereby patients living at a greater distance had better health outcomes. The remaining 19 studies found no relationship. There was a large variation in the data available to the studies on the patients' geographical locations and the healthcare facilities attended, and the methods used to calculate travel times and distances were not consistent across studies.
Conclusions The review observed that a relationship between travelling further and having worse health outcomes cannot be ruled out and should be considered within the healthcare services location debate.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              In sub-Saharan Africa, women are most likely to receive skilled and adequate childbirth care in hospital settings, yet the use of hospital for childbirth is low and inequitable. The poorest and those living furthest away from a hospital are most affected. But the relative contribution of poverty and travel time is convoluted, since hospitals are often located in wealthier urban places and are scarcer in poorer remote area. This study aims to partition the variability in hospital-based childbirth by poverty and travel time in four sub-Saharan African countries.
            
            
              Methods
              We used data from the most recent Demographic and Health Survey in Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania. For each country, geographic coordinates of survey clusters, the master list of hospital locations and a high-resolution map of land surface friction were used to estimate travel time from each DHS cluster to the nearest hospital with a shortest-path algorithm. We quantified and compared the predicted probabilities of hospital-based childbirth resulting from one standard deviation (SD) change around the mean for different model predictors.
            
            
              Results
              The mean travel time to the nearest hospital, in minutes, was 27 (Kenya), 31 (Malawi), 25 (Nigeria) and 62 (Tanzania). In Kenya, a change of 1SD in wealth led to a 33.2 percentage points change in the probability of hospital birth, whereas a 1SD change in travel time led to a change of 16.6 percentage points. The marginal effect of 1SD change in wealth was weaker than that of travel time in Malawi (13.1 vs. 34.0 percentage points) and Tanzania (20.4 vs. 33.7 percentage points). In Nigeria, the two were similar (22.3 vs. 24.8 percentage points) but their additive effect was twice stronger (44.6 percentage points) than the separate effects. Random effects from survey clusters also explained substantial variability in hospital-based childbirth in all countries, indicating other unobserved local factors at play.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Both poverty and long travel time are important determinants of hospital birth, although they vary in the extent to which they influence whether women give birth in a hospital within and across countries. This suggests that different strategies are needed to effectively enable poor women and women living in remote areas to gain access to skilled and adequate care for childbirth.},

A review of public policy interventions shows all three governments have taken major legislative steps to protect remaining forests, but studies evaluating deforestation trends and associated factors in this region are scarce or non-existent. Here, we make a direct contribution to this knowledge gap by assessing deforestation trends within Paraná Atlantic forests of Argentina's Misiones, Brazil's Paraná, and Paraguay's Alto Paraná between 2000 and 2020. Over this period about 20\% of forest cover was lost in Misiones, 13\% in Paraná, and 18\% in Alto Paraná. The odds of observed deforestation, else constant, showed nuanced associations with proximity to nearest roads, cities, and ports. Higher levels of economic growth were directly associated with deforestation, as were increases in population density over the entire period. Protected area designation between years 2000 and 2020 showed effectiveness in lowering odds of deforestation with heterogeneous associations across countries. Our results reflect associational inferences with estimated deforestation; future research should investigate causal effects of protected designation, and assess its role in avoided degradation and wider socio-economic impacts.},

world. Relentless agricultural encroachment has left less than 10\% of its original cover intact. Many
strategies and programs have been initiated, such as Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes,
to halt forest cover loss. While the approach of ecosystem services (ES) has been continuously applied
by policy makers, it has not been perceived strongly by the direct users of the forest. This study provides
a comprehensive understanding on how landowners in the BAAPA perceive and benefits from ES derived
from the forest and examines the influence of farmers on forest conservation. The results were obtained
from an extensive household survey performed in the BAAPA region. An understanding of the high ecological
value of the forest is common to all farmers. A strong dependency on forest-related products was
observed for small and medium landowners whereas large-scale farmers considered the forest’s main
value to be mostly recreational and cultural. PES appears to be well accepted by forest owners, but it must
receive stronger promotion. Understanding the importance of ecosystem services is a valuable contribution
toward to conserving natural resources.},

	abstract = {"This book draws attention to political aspects of sustainable development goal-setting, exploring the Sustainable Development Goals at the global-national nexus during their first five years. After broad global deliberation and political negotiations, the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted in the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 2015 and by now many countries have political structures in place for working towards their realisation. This book explores three concepts to call attention to political qualities of processes related to the SDGs: legitimacy, responsibility, and accountability. Legitimacy is required to obtain broad political ownership for policy goals in order for them to become effective in addressing cross-border sustainability challenges. Responsibility needs to be clearly distributed among political institutions if a long-term set of broad goals such as the SDGs are to be realised. Accountability to the public is the retrospective mirror of political responsibility. The Politics of the Sustainable Development Goals contributes new knowledge on political processes at the nexus of global and national levels, focusing on three countries at different levels of socio-economic development and democratisation, namely Ghana, Tanzania, and Sweden. These countries thereby illustrate a variety of challenges related to the realisation of the SDGs. This book will be of great interest to students and scholars of sustainable development, international organisations, and global politics"--},

	abstract = {For the monitoring and assessment of Atlantic Forest ecosystems, key indicators of the regeneration stage are considered. However, the current classification of these stages by experts does not consider the possible differences among such ecosystems. In order to test the hypothesis of significant differences, Atlantic Forest ecosystems in southern Brazil were compared at the same stage (initial, medium, and advanced stages of regeneration). An extensive database of the floristic forest inventory of Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil, with 460 sampling units, was used, addressing the seasonal deciduous forest (SDF), dense ombrophilous forest (DOF), and mixed ombrophilous forest (MOF). The regeneration stage of each sample unit was previously classified by experts using five key indicators (basal area per hectare—BA/ha; number of individuals per hectare—N/ha; number of species—S; Shannon biodiversity index—H’; and diameter at breast height—DBH). The Kruskal–Wallis method and pairwise multiple comparisons based on Dunn’s procedure were applied, considering two-way tests with 5\% significance, and 95\% power. The statistical tests confirmed the research hypothesis, namely, that the key indicators had significant differences in the later regeneration stages of Atlantic Forest ecosystems. For instance, S in DOF was statistically higher (p {\textless} 0.001) than in MOF and SDF (44 ± 9); N in SDF was significantly lower (394 ± 248 at mid-stage) compared to MOF (475 ± 233) and DOF (545 ± 173); and H’ showed increasing differences towards more advanced stages. Considering that the stage of forest regeneration is the main criterion for decision-making between suppression and conservation of forest ecosystems, the results achieved should support the review of current procedures applied to the classification of successional stages. Given the demonstrated differences, in the next steps of research, we will evaluate and propose specific standards for each Atlantic Forest ecosystem, i.e., intervals of discriminating values for the key indicators applicable to this biome.},

	abstract = {Abstract Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves 1 and in the first imaging of a black hole 2 . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {Within the framework of Web 2.0 mapping applications, the most striking example of a geographical application is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. OSM aims to create a free digital map of the world and is implemented through the engagement of participants in a mode similar to software development in Open Source projects. The information is collected by many participants, collated on a central database, and distributed in multiple digital formats through the World Wide Web. This type of information was termed ‘Volunteered Geographical Information’ (VGI) by Goodchild, 2007. However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of VGI. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing OSM information. The examination focuses on analysis of its quality through a comparison with Ordnance Survey (OS) datasets. The analysis focuses on London and England, since OSM started in London in August 2004 and therefore the study of these geographies provides the best understanding of the achievements and difficulties of VGI. The analysis shows that OSM information can be fairly accurate: on average within about 6 m of the position recorded by the OS, and with approximately 80\% overlap of motorway objects between the two datasets. In the space of four years, OSM has captured about 29\% of the area of England, of which approximately 24\% are digitised lines without a complete set of attributes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings to the study of VGI as well as suggesting future research directions.},

SAGA is coded in C++ in an object oriented design and runs under several operating systems including Windows and Linux. Key functional features of the modular software architecture comprise an application programming interface for the development and implementation of new geoscientific methods, a user friendly graphical user interface with many visualization options, a command line interpreter, and interfaces to interpreted languages like R and Python. The current version 2.1.4 offers more than 600 tools, which are implemented in dynamically loadable libraries or shared objects and represent the broad scopes of SAGA in numerous fields of geoscientific endeavor and beyond. In this paper, we inform about the system's architecture, functionality, and its current state of development and implementation. Furthermore, we highlight the wide spectrum of scientific applications of SAGA in a review of published studies, with special emphasis on the core application areas digital terrain analysis, geomorphology, soil science, climatology and meteorology, as well as remote sensing.},

	abstract = {Access to healthcare is a requirement for human well-being that is constrained, in part, by the allocation of healthcare resources relative to the geographically dispersed human population1–3. Quantifying access to care globally is challenging due to the absence of a comprehensive database of healthcare facilities. We harness major data collection efforts underway by OpenStreetMap, Google Maps and academic researchers to compile the most complete collection of facility locations to date. Leveraging the geographically variable strengths of our facility datasets, we use an established methodology4 to characterize travel time to healthcare facilities in unprecedented detail. We produce maps of travel time with and without access to motorized transport, thus characterizing travel time to healthcare for populations distributed across the wealth spectrum. We find that just 8.9\% of the global population (646 million people) cannot reach healthcare within one hour if they have access to motorized transport, and that 43.3\% (3.16 billion people) cannot reach a healthcare facility by foot within one hour. Our maps highlight an additional vulnerability faced by poorer individuals in remote areas and can help to estimate whether individuals will seek healthcare when it is needed, as well as providing an evidence base for efficiently distributing limited healthcare and transportation resources to underserved populations both now and in the future.},

	abstract = {The landscape configuration of socio-ecological land systems results from the interaction between the environmental conditions (relatively homogeneous within ecoregions) and country-level management and land-use decisions. However, social, land-use and sustainability research disciplines often study each independently. We used Euclidean distance analyses of five indicators of land systems functioning to explore the geographical patterns of across-border human-induced asymmetries in transnational ecoregions of South America. The most asymmetric transnational ecoregions occurred in the tropical rainforest biome which also showed the widest range of asymmetry values compared to other biomes. In contrast, transnational ecoregions in montane grasslands showed comparatively little asymmetries, and tropical dry forests showed intermediate asymmetry values. This pattern indicates that major asymmetries occur in land systems located in productive biomes with a comparatively recent history of development, whereas mature socio-ecosystems with a long history of human land use are more homogeneous across borders. In some cases, asymmetries may stabilize as a consequence of reinforcing feedbacks that promote contrasting land-use decisions across borders, including, for example, the establishment of protected areas, or the promotion of agro-industrial activities. Transnational socio-ecological land systems can be used to evaluate alternatives for sustainable development because they highlight the influence of institutions under different governance regimes in defining the spatial configuration and ecological properties of regions. We invite land-use and sustainability scientists to consider political border interactions as valuable “natural experiments” to better understand the interrelations between biophysical and political systems in defining planetary geographical-ecology in the Anthropocene.},

Improving access, especially in rural areas, requires useful measures of current access to the locations where these resources and opportunities are found. Recent work has developed a global map of travel times to cities with more than 50,000 people in the year 2015. However, the provision of resources and opportunities will differ across the broad spectrum of settlements that range from small towns to megacities, and access to this spectrum of settlement sizes should also be measured. Here we present a suite of nine global travel-time accessibility indicators for the year 2015, at approximately one-kilometre spatial resolution, for a range of settlement size classes. We validated the travel-time estimates against journey times from a Google driving directions application across 1,511 2° × 2° tiles representing 47,812 journeys. We observed very good agreement, though our estimates were more frequently shorter than those from the Google application with a median difference of −13.7 minutes and a median percentage difference of −16.9\%.},

Climate change is, therefore, expected to have an impact on the volume of bicycle traffic, which is an important factor in the planning and design of bicycle infrastructures. To predict bicycle traffic in a changed climate in the city of Berlin, this paper compares a traditional statistical approach to three machine learning models. For this purpose, a cross-validation procedure is developed that evaluates model performance on the basis of prediction accuracy. XGBoost showed the best performance and is used for the prediction of bicycle counts. Our results indicate that we can expect an overall annual increase in bicycle traffic of 1-4\% in the city of Berlin due to the changes in local weather conditions caused by global climate change. The biggest changes are expected to occur in the winter season with increases of 11-14\% due to rising temperatures and only slight increases in precipitation.},

However, intermodality presents challenges for transport providers, and has its drawbacks for users, who prefer connections that do not require changing between transport modes. As a basis for forming recommendations to facilitate intermodality, we first analysed the status quo of intermodal mobility in four European metropolises: Berlin, Copenhagen, Hamburg and Paris. Subsequently, we conducted an expert survey in which we asked experts in the four cities about the future share and development of intermodality, its future relevance and potential of intermodality in transport planning, and how various factors on both the demand and supply side influence the level of intermodal activity. According to our findings, most experts foresee an increase in the share of intermodal trips. They also believe the relevance of including intermodality considerations in transport planning to be increasing. The increase of intermodal mobility will be driven by factors such as reduced vehicle ownership, but also by new mobility patterns. The latter can be explained by social factors such as urbanisation or digitalisation that affect the lifestyle of cities’ inhabitants in future.},

Geographie fördert insbesondere das dafür unabdingbare Systemverständnis. Die Betonung der Erde als System kommt besonders in den Darstellungen zu den Stoffkreisläufen zum Ausdruck. Eine zeitgemäße Physische Geographie muss aber auch den Mensch als prägenden Faktor der Umwelt einbeziehen. Geographie ist integrativ und folgt einem gesamtheitlichen Ansatz im Sinne der Mensch-Umwelt-Forschung. Um dieser Brückenstellung der Geographie zu entsprechen, sind auch Themenkreise wie Global Change sowie einige Umweltfragen in das Buch mit aufgenommen. Die Ausführungen [...] vermitteln [...] die klassischen Themenbereiche Geologie und Geomorphologie sowie Klima-, Hydro-, Vegetations- und Bodengeographie. Ergänzt werden sie durch die Betrachtung von verschiedenen integrativen Problemfeldern. Hierzu gehören naturräumliche Gliederungen und Stoffkreisläufe ebenso wie die Beschäftigung mit Fragen des Umweltschutzes oder des Globalen Wandels. Auch die für das Grundverständnis von Geographie wesentlichen Arbeitsmethoden wie Feld- und Labormethoden, GIS und Fernerkundung werden in einem eigenen Kapitel vorgestellt. Kurze Exkurse zu aktuellen Themen, Problemen und Fragestellungen runden diese Themen ab und unterstreichen die Stellung der Geographie als eine lebensnahe, problemorientierte Wissenschaft. Viele Fallbeispiele lenken den Fokus auf Mitteleuropa, ihr Bezug zum globalen Kontext wird jedoch aufgezeigt. (Orig.).},

It holds that taking road space from cars is justiﬁed from social, health, environmental and economic viewpoints.

	abstract = {This article shows how the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany have made bicycling a safe, convenient and practical way to get around their cities. The analysis relies on national aggregate data as well as case studies of large and small cities in each country. The key to achieving high levels of cycling appears to be the provision of separate cycling facilities along heavily travelled roads and at intersections, combined with traffic calming of most residential neighbourhoods. Extensive cycling rights of way in the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany are complemented by ample bike parking, full integration with public transport, comprehensive traffic education and training of both cyclists and motorists, and a wide range of promotional events intended to generate enthusiasm and wide public support for cycling. In addition to their many pro‐bike policies and programmes, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany make driving expensive as well as inconvenient in central cities through a host of taxes and restrictions on car ownership, use and parking. Moreover, strict land‐use policies foster compact, mixed‐use developments that generate shorter and thus more bikeable trips. It is the coordinated implementation of this multi‐faceted, mutually reinforcing set of policies that best explains the success of these three countries in promoting cycling. For comparison, the article portrays the marginal status of cycling in the UK and the USA, where only about 1\% of trips are by bike.},

This paper analyzes how, and why, such temporary uses of space have been harnessed in recent economic and urban development policies and in the official city marketing discourse in Berlin post-2000, in the context of the discursive and policy shift toward the promotion of Berlin as a “creative city.” The gradual process of enlistment of new forms of cultural and social expression by policy-makers and real estate developers for urban development and place marketing purposes has put pressure on the very existence and experimental nature of “temporary uses” and “interim spaces.” These have consequently been going through various trajectories of displacement, transformation, commodification, resistance, or disappearance, and in particular cases have become the focus of intense local conflicts.},

Except for Berlin, they represent the very best in coordinated policies and programs to make cycling safe, convenient, and attractive. Not only are cycling levels extraordinarily high in these cities, but virtually everyone cycles: women as well as men, the old and the young, the rich and the poor. Moreover, they cycle for a wide range of daily, practical trips purposes and not mainly for recreation. Berlin is a special case. It does not even approach the five other cities in their cycling orientation. Nevertheless, its recent measures to encourage cycling have achieved an impressive bike share of trips for such a large city, higher than any other European city of that size. Thus, all six of the bicycling case study cities examined in this article truly are at the frontiers of cycling. They have many lessons to offer other cities in the Western World about the best ways to encourage more cycling. difu},

	abstract = {Cities are increasingly seeking to learn from experiences elsewhere when planning programmes of sustainable transition management, and the contingencies of policy-learning arrangements in this field are beginning to receive greater attention. This paper applies insights from the field of policy mobilities to the burgeoning field of transition management to critically explore a proposed ?learning relationship? between Berlin (Germany) and Manchester (UK) around cycling policy. Drawing on qualitative data, the paper casts doubt over the existing consensus attributing recent growth in bicycle use in Berlin to concerted governmental interventions. A multi-actor analysis suggests that contextual factors caused the growth in cycling and that policy has been largely reactive. The emergence and circulation of the Berlin cycling renaissance as a policy model is then traced through policy documents and interviews with actors in Manchester, UK, to understand why and how it has become a model for action elsewhere. It is concluded that Berlin?s cycling renaissance has been simplified and mobilised to demonstrate the requisite ambition and proficiency to secure competitive funds for sustainable urban transport. The paper develops an original study of the role policy knowledge and learning play in sustainable urban transition management, and argues that attending to the dynamics of policy learning can enhance our understanding of its successes and failures.},

	abstract = {Sustainability is a major driver of world policy for cities, and public transport is said to be a more sustainable mode of travel than other modes. But how do public transport (PT) systems in different cities compare to each other? This paper measures the relative sustainability of public transport systems between cities rather than between modes within cities. However, its primary focus is to explore the extent to which public transport sustainability is influenced by land use. Do cities with low-density land use automatically have poor sustainability performance? Do high-density megacities always have good sustainability performance relative to other cities? Does land use mean some cities cannot improve sustainability performance? These are some of the questions this research seeks to explore through an empirical study of land use and PT sustainability metrics using correlation/cross sectional and regression analyses. Results suggest that westernized, developed countries (Western Europe, North America, and Oceania) have good environmental and social sustainability performance but poor service effectiveness and economic performance. Asia and Latin America perform the other way around, better on economic and service effectiveness and worse on social and economic performance. Eastern Europe is the one region with higher sustainability performance all around. Prague, Dakar and Tokyo are at the top of 98 cities studied, while Dubai, Shizuoka (Japan), Denver, and Johannesburg perform the worst. Land-use results show that population and job density present the highest correlation with PT sustainability metrics, implying that about a third of overall sustainability performance of public transport in cities might be explained by land use. Higher-density land use improves sustainability performance. A wider range of land-use indicators is more strongly correlated with the service effectiveness categories of sustainability indicators and to less strongly correlated with the economic sustainability indicators, suggesting that Western cities with poor service effectiveness and economic sustainability performance should densify cities to address sustainability challenges. Policy implications and areas for future research are explored.},

	abstract = {Mobility behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic have opened a window of opportunity for an accelerated transition towards sustainable mobility. Many European cities installed temporary cycling infra­ structure which can be considered a niche innovation in the Multi-Level-Perspective of transitions (Geels, 2002). We empirically assess the effects of such temporary infrastructure in terms of air quality, behaviour, and acceptance, with a focus on the city of Berlin, Germany. The numerous pop-up bike lanes installed serve as an inter- and transdisciplinary case study to systematically capture these effects. We conducted a survey among Berlin citizens (n= 1,661), analysed cycling usage data, and measured the exposure of cyclists to air quality before and after the implementation of one pop-up bike lane during the first wave of COVID-19. Results show that pop-up bike lanes receive high levels of acceptance, increase cycling usage on the respective street, and reduce cyclists’ exposure to nitrogen dioxide. Their implementation fosters an innovative mind-set of transport planning: to temporarily try out new street designs, learn from these practical experiences, improve the designs, and then permanently implement the ones best proven in practice. We conclude that PUBL can accelerate the regime shift from car-oriented to bicycle-friendly cities because of its many demonstrated positive impacts.},

Regarding the predicted climate change, extreme weather events, like heat waves and drought episodes, will be more frequent and thus their impact on forest ecosystems is expected to be stronger. In this context, sustainable forest management and monitoring strategies have to be adapted for saving the multifunctional role of forests. The retrieval of biophysical and biological parameters from remote sensing hyperspectral imagery is a substantial issue for the accurate assessment of forest decline. In this study, we tested the potential of high resolution imaging and non-imaging spectroscopy data for detecting biochemical vegetation parameters during an induced drought stress. For this we implemented a controlled drying-experiment on the European Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) during two field campaigns in 2011 and 2012. The assessment of image data, spectral signatures and the derived vegetation indices give conclusions about the plant physiological conditions. The analysis includes the abilities of the chosen vegetation indices concerning drought analysis and their sensitivity towards changes in chlorophyll and water contents.},

	abstract = {Monitoring global biodiversity from space through remotely sensing geospatial patterns has high potential to add to our knowledge acquired by field observation. Although a framework of essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) is emerging for monitoring biodiversity, its poor alignment with remote sensing products hinders interpolation between field observations. This study compiles a comprehensive, prioritized list of remote sensing biodiversity products that can further improve the monitoring of geospatial biodiversity patterns, enhancing the EBV framework and its applicability. The ecosystem structure and ecosystem function EBV classes, which capture the biological effects of disturbance as well as habitat structure, are shown by an expert review process to be the most relevant, feasible, accurate and mature for direct monitoring of biodiversity from satellites. Biodiversity products that require satellite remote sensing of a finer resolution that is still under development are given lower priority (for example, for the EBV class species traits). Some EBVs are not directly measurable by remote sensing from space, specifically the EBV class genetic composition. Linking remote sensing products to EBVs will accelerate product generation, improving reporting on the state of biodiversity from local to global scales.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for water stress detection in crop canopies using a radiative transfer modelling approach and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI). Airborne imagery was acquired with a 6-band multispectral camera yielding 15 cm spatial resolution and 10 nm FWHM over 3 crops comprising two tree-structured orchards and a corn field. The methodology is based on the PRI as a water stress indicator, and a radiative transfer modelling approach to simulate PRI baselines for non-stress conditions as a function of leaf structure, chlorophyll concentration (Cab), and canopy leaf area index (LAI). The simulation work demonstrates that canopy PRI is affected by structural parameters such as LAI, Cab, leaf structure, background effects, viewing angle and sun position. The modelling work accounts for such leaf biochemical and canopy structural inputs to simulate the PRI-based water stress thresholds for non-stress conditions. Water stress levels are quantified by comparing the image-derived PRI and the simulated non-stress PRI (sPRI) obtained through radiative transfer. PRI simulation was conducted using the coupled PROSPECT-SAILH models for the corn field, and the PROSPECT leaf model coupled with FLIGHT 3D radiative transfer model for the olive and peach orchards. Results obtained confirm that PRI is a pre-visual indicator of water stress, yielding good relationships for the three crops studied with canopy temperature, an indicator of stomatal conductance (r2=0.65 for olive, r2=0.8 for peach, and r2=0.72 for maize). PRI values of deficit irrigation treatments in olive and peach were consistently higher than the modelled PRI for the study sites, yielding relationships with water potential (r2=0.84) that enabled the identification of stressed crowns accounting for within-field LAI and Cab variability. The methodology presented here for water stress detection is based on the visible part of the spectrum, and therefore it has important implications for remote sensing applications in agriculture. This method may be a better alternative to using the thermal region, which has limitations to acquire operationally high spatial resolution thermal imagery.},

	abstract = {Automatic methods for an early detection of plant diseases are vital for precision crop protection. The main contribution of this paper is a procedure for the early detection and differentiation of sugar beet diseases based on Support Vector Machines and spectral vegetation indices. The aim was (I) to discriminate diseased from non-diseased sugar beet leaves, (II) to differentiate between the diseases Cercospora leaf spot, leaf rust and powdery mildew, and (III) to identify diseases even before specific symptoms became visible. Hyperspectral data were recorded from healthy leaves and leaves inoculated with the pathogens Cercospora beticola, Uromyces betae or Erysiphe betae causing Cercospora leaf spot, sugar beet rust and powdery mildew, respectively for a period of 21 days after inoculation. Nine spectral vegetation indices, related to physiological parameters were used as features for an automatic classification. Early differentiation between healthy and inoculated plants as well as among specific diseases can be achieved by a Support Vector Machine with a radial basis function as kernel. The discrimination between healthy sugar beet leaves and diseased leaves resulted in classification accuracies up to 97\%. The multiple classification between healthy leaves and leaves with symptoms of the three diseases still achieved an accuracy higher than 86\%. Furthermore the potential of presymptomatic detection of the plant diseases was demonstrated. Depending on the type and stage of disease the classification accuracy was between 65\% and 90\%.},

	abstract = {Early stress detection in crop plants is highly relevant, but hard to achieve. We hypothesize that close range hyperspectral imaging is able to uncover stress related processes non-destructively in the early stages which are invisible to the human eye. We propose an approach which combines unsupervised and supervised methods in order to identify several stages of progressive stress development from series of hyperspectral images. Stress of an entire plant is detected by stress response levels at pixel scale. The focus is on drought stress in barley (Hordeum vulgare). Unsupervised learning is used to separate hyperspectral signatures into clusters related to different stages of stress response and progressive senescence. Whereas all such signatures may be found in both, well watered and drought stressed plants, their respective distributions differ. Ordinal classification with Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used to quantify and visualize the distribution of progressive stages of senescence and to separate well watered from drought stressed plants. For each senescence stage a distinctive set of most relevant Vegetation Indices (VIs) is identified. The method has been applied on two experiments involving potted barley plants under well watered and drought stress conditions in a greenhouse. Drought stress is detected up to ten days earlier than using NDVI. Furthermore, it is shown that some VIs have overall relevance, while others are specific to particular senescence stages. The transferability of the method to the field is illustrated by an experiment on maize (Zea mays).},

In recent years, remarkable results have been achieved in the early detection of weeds, plant diseases and insect pests in crops. These achievements are related both to the development of non-invasive, high resolution optical sensors and data analysis methods that are able to cope with the resolution, size and complexity of the signals from these sensors. Several methods of machine learning have been utilized for precision agriculture such as support vector machines and neural networks for classification (supervised learning); k-means and self-organizing maps for clustering (unsupervised learning). These methods are able to calculate both linear and non-linear models, require few statistical assumptions and adapt flexibly to a wide range of data characteristics. Successful applications include the early detection of plant diseases based on spectral features and weed detection based on shape descriptors with supervised or unsupervised learning methods. This review gives a short introduction into machine learning, analyses its potential for precision crop protection and provides an overview of instructive examples from different fields of precision agriculture.},

	abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing imagery needs to be converted into tangible information which can be utilised in conjunction with other data sets, often within widely used Geographic Information Systems (GIS). As long as pixel sizes remained typically coarser than, or at the best, similar in size to the objects of interest, emphasis was placed on per-pixel analysis, or even sub-pixel analysis for this conversion, but with increasing spatial resolutions alternative paths have been followed, aimed at deriving objects that are made up of several pixels. This paper gives an overview of the development of object based methods, which aim to delineate readily usable objects from imagery while at the same time combining image processing and GIS functionalities in order to utilize spectral and contextual information in an integrative way. The most common approach used for building objects is image segmentation, which dates back to the 1970s. Around the year 2000 GIS and image processing started to grow together rapidly through object based image analysis (OBIA - or GEOBIA for geospatial object based image analysis). In contrast to typical Landsat resolutions, high resolution images support several scales within their images. Through a comprehensive literature review several thousand abstracts have been screened, and more than 820 OBIA-related articles comprising 145 journal papers, 84 book chapters and nearly 600 conference papers, are analysed in detail. It becomes evident that the first years of the OBIA/GEOBIA developments were characterised by the dominance of ‘grey’ literature, but that the number of peer-reviewed journal articles has increased sharply over the last four to five years. The pixel paradigm is beginning to show cracks and the OBIA methods are making considerable progress towards a spatially explicit information extraction workflow, such as is required for spatial planning as well as for many monitoring programmes.},

	abstract = {Der Artikel beleuchtet das Thema Erwerbshybridisierung am Beispiel des Kulturbereiches. Dort zeichnet sich ab, dass Erwerbsverläufe zunehmend mehrgleisig sind und eine steigende Anzahl an Erwerbstätigen zu Grenzgängern und Grenzgängerinnen werden, die die Grenzen der unterschiedlichen Erwerbsformen ausloten. Die These ist, dass Grenzgänger und Grenzgängerinnen die Erwerbsform Selbstständigkeit flexibel nutzen, um Berufs- und Lebenskonzepte mit Arbeitsmarktrealitäten zu synchronisieren. Eine praxisnahe Betrachtung von Arbeitsverhältnissen sollte sich dem Phänomen der Erwerbshybridisierung zuwenden, da Grenzgänge zwischen Erwerbsformen, zwischen Arbeitsverhältnissen sowie zwischen Erwerbsfeldern als eine Verschränkung der Flexibilisierung von Arbeit mit individuellen Erwerbsstrategien zu verstehen sind. Es wird untersucht, in welchen Formen Grenzgänge im Kulturbereich auftreten und zwischen drei Dimensionen unterschieden.},

	abstract = {Für eine Neubewertung der geomorphologischen Entwicklung der Umgebung des Rangsdorfer Sees wurde eine Strategie entwickelt, die die technischen Analysemöglichkeiten eines GIS mit der geomorphologischen Arbeit im Gelände kombiniert. Die digitale Aufarbeitung von geologischen und topographischen Karten verschiedenen Alters bildet die Datengrundlage für die Arbeit im GIS. Im Zentrum stand hierbei die Aktualisierung der Preußischen Geologischen Karten aus dem ausgehenden 19. Jahrhundert. Nach der Verschneidung dieser Daten mit einem eigens erstellten DGM konnte ein vorläufiges Modell zur geomorphologischen Entwicklung mit folgenden wesentlichen Punkten erstellt werden: Ein durch saalezeitliche Stauchungskomplexe vorgeprägtes Ausgangsrelief unterliegt weichselzeitlich einer intensiven Zerschneidung durch subglaziale Schmelzwässer. Im Zuge der Eisfreiwerdung kommt es zu subaerischen Abflüssen mit vorwiegend akkumulierender Wirkung und damit in den Rinnenbereichen zur Verschüttung großer Mengen an Toteis, deren späteres Austauen zur Entstehung einer ausgedehnten Seenlandschaft führt. Im Spätglazial werden Dünen aufgeweht. Im Holozän dominieren akkumulative Prozesse, was eine Nivellierung des Reliefs zur Folge hat. Bei der Verifizierung dieses Modells mit Hilfe von Geländearbeiten zeigte sich, dass die saalezeitliche Vorprägung des Reliefs von noch größerer Bedeutung ist als zunächst angenommen: Sowohl die Vollformen als auch die Tiefenlinien waren bereits saalezeitlich angelegt. Für das Weichsel-Glazial konnte die auf den Hochflächen vorwiegend glazial-erosive und im Bereich der Niederungen vorwiegend glazial-akkumulative Prägung bestätigt werden.},

	abstract = {Das Jungmoränenland südlich Berlins stellt ein Mosaik aus ausgedehnten Schmelzwasserabflussbahnen und inselartig daraus aufragenden Platten dar.  Teile des Großreliefs wurden bereits saalezeitlich angelegt.  Der weichselzeitliche Eisvorstoß beeinflusste relativ schwach den Untergrund und hinterließ einen meist geringmächtigen, lückenhaften Till. Das jüngste Inlandeis wirkte vor allem über die Schmelzwässer. Es bildeten sich zahlreiche Glaziale Rinnen und mächtige Vorschütt- und Sandersande.  Die lückenhaft ausgebildete Brandenburger Eisrandlage markiert nicht das weiteste Vordringen des weichselzeitlichen Inlandeises. Der Maximalvorstoß stieß 2 bis 12 km weiter nach Süden vor. Östlich von Luckenwalde erreichte er den Südrand des Baruther Urstromtales.  Dem Maximalvorstoß wird im Baruther Urstromtal die älteste von vier Abflussphasen zugeordnet. Dem Ältesten Baruther Urstrom folgte der Ältere Urstrom, der die Brandenburger Eisrandlage entwässerte. Der Jüngere und der Jüngste Baruther Urstrom führten die Schmelzwässer ab, die beim Zurückschmelzen des Eises von der Brandenburger Eisrandlage anfielen. Zwischen denen einzelnen Abflussphasen erfolgte kein Trockenfallen des Urstromtales. Deutliche Terrassenkanten fehlen innerhalb der Urstromtalungen.  Die Entwicklung der Abflussbahnen nördlich des Baruther Urstromtales verlief, vom Unterspreewald ausgehend, in drei Hauptphasen mit den aufeinanderfolgenden Abflusszielen Beelitz (?), Potsdam und Berlin.  Es existiert keine Rückzugsstaffel nördlich der Brandenburger Eisrandlage.  Die Spree hat im Unterspreewald vier Gerinnebettgenerationen ausgebildet. Braided river-Strukturen, Großmäander, Kleinmäander und das rezente Anastomosieren folgten seit dem Weichselspätglazial aufeinander. Die Spree floss vom Unterspreewald immer nach Osten und nie nach Nordwesten ab. Die Ursache dieses Umweges wird im späten Durchbruch der Spree durch den Lausitzer Grenzwall gesehen, so dass die Aufwehung von Dünen den kürzeren Weg in das Berliner Urstromtal blockierte.},

Zudem existieren zahlreiche, oft als Synonym verwendete Begrifflichkeiten wie ,,Industrie 4.0“ oder ,,IoT“. Dieses breite, inkonsistente Spektrum führt zwangsläufig zu einer Verwässerung des Begriffes sowie zu teilweise konträren Zielvorstellungen. Aus diesem Grund widmet sich der Artikel zunächst einer klaren Definition von Digitalisierung. Anschließend wird eine fragebogenbasierte Methodik vorgestellt, die ein fünfstufiges Relevanzstufenraster sowie eine Systematik zur Beurteilung des Digitalisierungsreifegrades eines Unternehmens enthält. Mit dem Relevanzstufenraster wird eingeschätzt, für welche Unternehmensbereiche Digitalisierung relevant ist. Der Digitalisierungsreifegrad zeigt auf, welchen Status das Unternehmen im Hinblick auf Digitalisierung bereits erreicht hat. In den Reifegrad fließen sowohl konkrete Fortschritte in den Bereichen Strategie, Organisation und Kultur sowie IT ein als auch die Verankerung der jeweiligen Aspekte im Managementsystem des Unternehmens.},

One expression of this warming is the observed increase in the occurrence of heatwaves5,6. Conceptually this increase is understood as a shift of the statistical distribution towards warmer temperatures, while changes in the width of the distribution are often considered small7. Here we show that this framework fails to explain the record-breaking central European summer temperatures in 2003, although it is consistent with observations from previous years. We find that an event like that of summer 2003 is statistically extremely unlikely, even when the observed warming is taken into account. We propose that a regime with an increased variability of temperatures (in addition to increases in mean temperature) may be able to account for summer 2003. To test this proposal, we simulate possible future European climate with a regional climate model in a scenario with increased atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations, and find that temperature variability increases by up to 100\%, with maximum changes in central and eastern Europe.},

	abstract = {The increasing Canadian beaver (Castor canadensis) population has caused forest damage in Finland. However, the occurrence, extent and importance of the damage have not been comprehensively studied. The field inspection was carried out in all of the beaver damage areas (n = 50) in the Anttola, Juva and Pieksämäki game management units in summer 1998. The characteristics of the damage areas, types of damage and the severity of the damage were examined. The size of the damage areas averaged 2.2 ha. The damage areas occurred on peatland forest more (p {\textless} 0.05) than expected. The dominant tree species were commercially valuable trees such as Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) (33 \%), Norway spruce (Picea abies) (18 \%) and birches (Betula spp.) (47 \%). Birch occurred as dominant tree species more (p {\textless} 0.05) than expected. The proportion of older forest development classes was considerable. The most important type of damage was flooding (50 \%) caused by the damming activity of beavers. The trees were dead or dying in 18 \% of the damage areas. It was estimated that the ecosystem engineering performed by beavers was of no importance in 28 \% of the damage areas. Prevention of beaver damage has been carried out in 80 \% of the damage areas. In the study area, beaver numbers have steadily increased, although the number of beavers taken by hunting and the allowed hunting harvest have sharply increased. It is suggested that the methods used to prevent beaver damage should be improved and a compensation system should be provided by the state for the most damaged areas. Beavers can cause damage to commercial forestry, and this should be taken into account more effectively in the management plans made by the game management districts.},

The combined data included a total of 97 390 young stands. The proportion of moose damage increased from 3.6\% to 8.6\% between the 8th NFI (1986–1994) and the 10th NFI (2004–2008). The majority (75\%) of the damage occurred in Scots pine-dominated stands. The proportion of damage was higher in aspen-dominated stands than in stands dominated by any other tree species. The tree species mixture also had a clear effect on the occurrence of damage. Pure Scots pine stands had less damage than mixed Scots pine stands, and moose damage decreased linearly with the increasing proportion of Scots pine. Stands on mineral soil had more frequent moose damage than stands on peatlands. The fertility class of the site had no straightforward effect on the damage frequency. Artificially regenerated stands had more damage than naturally regenerated stands. Accomplished soil preparation measures and the need for thinning or clearing operations increased moose damage. High proportions of moose damage in young stands were found around the country. In the 10th NFI, the largest concentration of damage was found in southwestern Finland. Our study shows the temporal and spatial changes in the occurrence of moose damage and pinpoints some important silvicultural factors affecting the relative risk of young stands over a large geographical area.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Droughts can have an impact on forest functioning and production, and even lead to tree mortality. However, drought is an elusive phenomenon that is difficult to quantify and define universally. In this study, we assessed the performance of a set of indicators that have been used to describe drought conditions in the summer months (June, July, August) over a 30-year period (1981\&ndash;2010) in Finland. Those indicators include the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation–Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the Soil Moisture Index (SMI), and the Soil Moisture Anomaly (SMA). Herein, regional soil moisture was produced by the land surface model JSBACH of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM). Results show that the buffering effect of soil moisture and the associated soil moisture memory can impact on the onset and duration of drought as indicated by the SMI and SMA, while the SPI and SPEI are directly controlled by meteorological conditions. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} In particular, we investigated whether the SMI, SMA and SPEI are able to indicate the Extreme Drought affecting Forest health (EDF), which we defined according to the extreme drought that caused severe forest damages in Finland in 2006. The EDF thresholds for the aforementioned indicators are suggested, based on the reported statistics of forest damages in Finland in 2006. SMI was found to be the best indicator in capturing the spatial extent of forest damage induced by the extreme drought in 2006. In addition, through the application of the EDF thresholds over the summer months of the 30-year study period, the SPEI and SMA tended to show more frequent EDF events and a higher fraction of influenced area than SMI. This is because the SPEI and SMA are standardized indicators that show the degree of anomalies from statistical means over the aggregation period of climate conditions and soil moisture, respectively. However, in boreal forests in Finland, the high initial soil moisture or existence of peat often prevent the EDFs indicated by the SPEI and SMA to produce very low soil moisture that could be indicated as EDFs by the SMI. Therefore, we consider SMI is more appropriate for indicating EDFs in boreal forests. The selected EDF thresholds for those indicators could be calibrated when there are more forest health observation data available. Furthermore, in the context of future climate scenarios, assessments of EDF risks in northern areas should, in addition to climate data, rely on a land surface model capable of reliable prediction of soil moisture.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The overall aim of this work is to provide land-use and land-cover change information as part of the KULUNDA project to develop sustainable land management policies and practices to stabilize agricultural yields and minimize ongoing degradation and desertiﬁcation processes. The area under investigation comprises around 80,000 km2 and belongs to what is thought of as Russia’s granary, an essential area in ensuring adequate food supply. Inadequate and outdated cultivation and agricultural management practices have caused ecological and socio-economic problems including soil degradation, desertiﬁcation and yield losses. The focus of this work is the quantiﬁcation and assessment of land-use and land-cover changes over time. Multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite data and historical topographic maps were used to detect changes of speciﬁc land-use and land-cover classes. The present work utilizes pixel-based data classiﬁcation approaches as well as object-based concepts and uses Landsat MSS, TM5, ETM and RapidEye data. For the 1950s, a GIS map layer-based approach is used and calibrated with panchromatic airphotograph data mosaics. Results of the land-use change mapping show an increase in cropland until 1989 of nearly 1 mio ha and a decrease until 2013/2014 of 500,000 ha directly connected to a decrease in grassland and steppe area until 1989 and an increase in grassland until 2013/2014. This study for the ﬁrst time quantiﬁes the land-cover change over 60 years in the Kulunda steppe region of Russia.},

Luftbilder, die auch das nahe Infrarot erfassen, werden heute dank den digitalen Kameras routinemässig aufgenommen. Farbinfrarot-Orthobilder lassen sich auf kantonaler und nationaler Ebene sehr einfach in die GIS-Anwendung einbinden. Daten aus flugzeuggetragenem Laserscanning sind für viele Anwendungen fast schon ein Standard geworden. Es existieren in die gewohnte Arbeitsumgebung integrierbare Werkzeuge, die es erlauben, mit den 3-D-Punktwolken Analysen sehr effizient durchzuführen und nützliche Produkte für den Waldbereich zu realisieren. Auch terrestrisches Laserscanning steht kurz vor der operationellen Anwendbarkeit. Fernerkundung entwickelt sich immer mehr zu einem Werkzeug für die praktische, tägliche Arbeit. Ist man sich der Möglichkeiten, aber auch der Grenzen bewusst, so vermag die Fernerkundung substanzielle Beiträge zur Unterstützung und Optimierung von terrestrischen Inventuren zu leisten und grossflächig Mehrwerte zu generieren.},

	abstract = {The expansion of urban development into wildland areas can have significant consequences, including an increase in the risk of structural damage from wildfire. Land-use and land-cover maps can assist decision-makers in targeting and prioritizing risk mitigation activities, and remote sensing techniques provide effective and efficient methods to create such maps. However, some image processing approaches may be more appropriate than others in distinguishing land-use and land-cover categories, particularly when classifying high spatial resolution imagery for urbanizing environments. Here we explore the accuracy of pixel-based and object-based classification methods used for mapping in the wildland–urban interface (WUI) with free, readily available, high spatial resolution urban imagery, which is available in many places to municipal and local fire management agencies. Results indicate that an object-based classification approach provides a higher accuracy than a pixel-based classification approach when distinguishing between the selected land-use and land-cover categories. For example, an object-based approach resulted in a 41.73\% greater accuracy for the built area category, which is of particular importance to WUI wildfire mitigation.},

Accuracy within subclasses was analyzed and indicated highest accuracy for large, dense vegetation. Error was caused by the following plant typologies: small vegetation, sparse canopy density, and gray vegetation. The outset of this procedure produces a binary matrix where the entire raster
set is classified highlighting the elements of the urban forest.},

All submissions have passed through a blind peer-review process resulting in what we believe is a timely volume of the highest scientific, theoretical and technical standards. The concept of OBIA first gained widespread interest within the GIScience (Geographic Information Science) community circa 2000, with the advent of the first commercial software for what was then termed ‘obje- oriented image analysis’. However, it is widely agreed that OBIA builds on older segmentation, edge-detection and classification concepts that have been used in remote sensing image analysis for several decades. Nevert- less, its emergence has provided a new critical bridge to spatial concepts applied in multiscale landscape analysis, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and the synergy between image-objects and their radiometric char- teristics and analyses in Earth Observation data (EO).},

	abstract = {This paper presents an automated classification system of landform elements based on object-oriented image analysis. First, several data layers are produced from Digital Terrain Models (DTM): elevation, profile curvature, plan curvature and slope gradient. Second, relatively homogenous objects are delineated at several levels through image segmentation. These object primatives are classified as landform elements using a relative classification model, built both on the surface shape and on the altitudinal position of objects. So far, slope aspect was not used in classification. The classification has nine classes: peaks and toe slopes (defined by the altitudinal position or the degree of dominance), steep slopes and flat/gentle slopes (defined by slope gradients), shoulders and negative contacts (defined by profile curvatures), head slopes, side slopes and nose slopes (defined by plan curvatures). Classes are defined using flexible fuzzy membership functions. Results are visually analyzed by draping them over DTMs. Specific fuzzy classification options were used to obtain an assessment of output accuracy. Two implementations of the methodology are compared using (1) Romanian datasets and (2) Berchtesgaden National Park, Germany. The methodology has proven to be reproducible; readily adaptable for diverse landscapes and datasets; and useful in respect to providing additional information for geomorphological and landscape studies. A major advantage of this new methodology is its transferability, given that it uses only relative values and relative positions to neighboring objects. The methodology introduced in this paper can be used for almost any application where relationships between topographic features and other components of landscapes are to be assessed.},

Laying out Harvey's position that geography could not remain objective in the face of urban poverty and associated ills, Social Justice and the City is perhaps the most widely cited work in the field. Harvey analyzes core issues in city planning and policy--employment and housing location, zoning, transport costs, concentrations of poverty--asking in each case about the relationship between social justice and space. How, for example, do built-in assumptions about planning reinforce existing distributions of income? Rather than leading him to liberal, technocratic solutions, Harvey's line of inquiry pushes him in the direction of a "revolutionary geography," one that transcends the structural limitations of existing approaches to space. Harvey's emphasis on rigorous thought and theoretical innovation gives the volume an enduring appeal. This is a book that raises big questions, and for that reason geographers and other social scientists regularly return to it.},

Der Autoverkehr ist in vielen Städten zu einer hohen Belastung geworden. Um die Alternativen zum Autoverkehr zu stärken, kursiert eine Vielzahl von Vorschlägen, etwa der Ausbau von Fahrradwegen, wenn nötig auch auf Kosten des Autoverkehrs. Dieser Beitrag präsentiert die Ergebnisse einer Erhebung unter knapp 7000 Haushaltsvorständen aus dem Jahr 2018, mit der die Zustimmung zu derartigen Vorschlägen eruiert wurde. Die daraus resultierenden Ergebnisse sind zwiespältiger Natur. Einerseits stimmt beispielsweise die absolute Mehrheit von 69 \% der Befragten für die Ausweisung von für Busse reservierter Fahrstreifen auf staubelasteten Straßen und knapp die Hälfte ist für Fahrverbote für Fahrzeuge, die Schadstoffgrenzwerte überschreiten. Andererseits ist die absolute Mehrheit von 57,3 \% der Befragten gegen höhere Kosten für das Parken in Innenstädten und knapp die Hälfte lehnt ein Verbot von Fahrzeugen mit Verbrennungsmotor ab dem Jahr 2035 ab.},

Streets have been primarily coded as a space for cars while excluding other traffic modes such as cyclists or pedestrians as well as uses that are not connected to movement. It is this logic and street code that the contemporary ideal of sustainable urban mobility aims to transform: streets should be made for people and accommodate different modes of mobility to overcome cars’ supremacy. This paper takes current planning processes and developments in Berlin and New York as a starting point to explore cyclists’ interest in street space and how it has historically developed since the mid-nineteenth century.

Zur Illustration der verschiedenen Stufen und Bedingungen von Akzeptanz im Kontext verkehrspolitischer Maßnahmen der Verkehrswende behandeln wir als aktuelles Fallbeispiel die ENavi-Modellregion Berlin. Angestoßen durch bürgerschaftliches Engagement im „Volksentscheid Fahrrad“ wurde hier ein umfassendes „Mobilitätsgesetz“ (MobG) unter Mitwirkung zivilgesellschaftlicher Organisationen erarbeitet, das im Juni 2018 verabschiedet wurde.},

	abstract = {The “Dust Bowl” drought of the 1930s was highly unusual for North America, deviating from the typical pattern forced by “La Nina” with the maximum drying in the central and northern Plains, warm temperature anomalies across almost the entire continent, and widespread dust storms. General circulation models (GCMs), forced by sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from the 1930s, produce a drought, but one that is centered in southwestern North America and without the warming centered in the middle of the continent. Here, we show that the inclusion of forcing from human land degradation during the period, in addition to the anomalous SSTs, is necessary to reproduce the anomalous features of the Dust Bowl drought. The degradation over the Great Plains is represented in the GCM as a reduction in vegetation cover and the addition of a soil dust aerosol source, both consequences of crop failure. As a result of land surface feedbacks, the simulation of the drought is much improved when the new dust aerosol and vegetation boundary conditions are included. Vegetation reductions explain the high temperature anomaly over the northern U.S., and the dust aerosols intensify the drought and move it northward of the purely ocean-forced drought pattern. When both factors are included in the model simulations, the precipitation and temperature anomalies are of similar magnitude and in a similar location compared with the observations. Human-induced land degradation is likely to have not only contributed to the dust storms of the 1930s but also amplified the drought, and these together turned a modest SST-forced drought into one of the worst environmental disasters the U.S. has experienced.},

	abstract = {A massive emission of light carbon about 56 Ma, recorded in marine and terrestrial sediments by a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE), caused a short-lived ({\textasciitilde}170 kyr) global warming event known as the Paleo­ cene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). The onset and core of this event is represented in the south Pyrenean Tremp-Graus Basin by two successive alluvial units, the Claret Conglomerate (CC) and the Yellowish Soils, which represent laterally juxtaposed depositional environments. It is generally agreed that these units record a dramatic increase in seasonal rain and an increased intra-annual humidity gradient during the PETM, but the timing of the sedimentary response to this hydrological change is a matter of debate. Some authors maintain that the CC was developed during the early, most intense phase of the carbon emission, others that its formation lagged by 16.5 ± 7.5 kyr behind the onset of the PETM. The latter claim was mainly based on the assumption that in two sections of this basin, Claret and Tendrui, the onset of the CIE occurs 3 and 8 m below the base of the CC, respectively. Here we show that in some zones between these two sections the CC was not deposited and the Yellowish Soil unit rests directly and conformably on the underlying Esplugafreda Formation. New δ13Corg data from this intervening zone provide evidence that the onset of the CIE is situated just {\textasciitilde}1 m below the Yellowish Soils. In adjacent sections the CC erosional base cuts down deeper than 5 m, thus removing or obscuring the chemostratigraphically-defined base of the PETM. A tentative estimate based on averaged sedimentation rates indicates that {\textasciitilde}3.8 kyr, or less, may have elapsed from the onset of the CIE to the arrival of PETM alluvium into the Claret-Tendrui study area, less than half of the lowest estimate of previous authors. Since the study area was situated about 15 km from the source area, our new estimate supports a rapid response of the sedimentary system to the hydrological change at the onset of the PETM.},

	abstract = {Sediment routing systems (SRSs) are a critical element of the global response to ongoing climate change. However SRS response to climate forcing is complex, fragmentary, and obscured when viewed over short, human time scales (10−1–102 yr). Over long time scales ({\textgreater}102–103 yr), the aggregated, system-wide response of SRSs to climate forcing can be gleaned with more confidence from the sedimentary record, but the nature and time scales of this aggregated response to abrupt climate change are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate the aggregated temporal response of a SRS in northern Spain to abrupt climate warming at the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM). Our results show that terrestrial sites in northern Spain record a temporal lag of 16.5 ± 7.5 k.y. between the onset of the PETM, defined by an abrupt negative excursion in the δ13C profile, and the onset of coarse-grained deposition. Within the same SRS at a deep marine site 500 km to the west, we observe a temporal lag of 16.5 ± 1.5 k.y. using an age model that is independent of that used for the terrestrial sites. These results suggest that the aggregated, system-wide response of SRSs to presentday global warming—if we take the PETM as an appropriate modern-day analogue—may persist for many millennia into the future.},
